## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Don't Skip Steps
Follow IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md in order. Each step builds on the previous one.

### 2. Test After Each Phase
Don't wait until the end. Test authentication after Phase 2, then after Phase 3, etc.

### 3. Ask Claude BEFORE Implementing
Get the code from Claude first, understand it, then implement it.

### 4. Use Quick Reference
Keep QUICK_REFERENCE.md open in a separate window while coding.

### 5. Read Learning Guide When Stuck
If you don't understand something, LEARNING_GUIDE.md explains the concepts.

### 6. Take Notes
Document your learning in your own words. It helps retention.
